# CT6049_Datbase_Library_Application
A web-based database library application, implementing SQL (MySQL) and non-SQL databases (MongoDB)

Implement two separate (but exactly same features) Library Database applications – one using MongoDB (NoSQL database) and the other using Oracle/ MySQL/ MariaDB (relational database). Both applications should have the same Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) as outlined below:

a) An input form for students to borrow/return books

b) An input form for students to pay fine

c) A report that displays book loan history of a student in a specific month

d) A report that displays total fine paid by a student in a specific month <br></br>

Your written report must consider the following: 

a)    Critically evaluate NoSQL and relational database modelling by showing examples from your implementation

b)   Explanation and critical analysis of 3-Tier architecture by showing examples from your implementation

c)    You should include the following in the appendix of your report:

·         Java source code

·         Database build script for Oracle/ MySQL/ MariaDB <br></br>
